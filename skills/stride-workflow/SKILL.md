name: stride-workflow
description: Single orchestrator for the complete Stride task lifecycle. Invoke when the user asks to claim a task, work on the next stride task, work on stride tasks, complete a stride task, enrich a stride task, decompose a goal, or create a goal or stride tasks. Replaces invoking stride-claiming-tasks, stride-completing-tasks, stride-creating-tasks, stride-creating-goals, stride-enriching-tasks, or stride-subagent-workflow directly — those are dispatched from inside this orchestrator. Walks through prerequisites, claiming, exploration, implementation, review, hooks, and completion. Handles both Claude Code (with subagent dispatch) and other environments (Cursor/Windsurf/Continue without subagents).

# Stride: Workflow Orchestrator

## Purpose

This skill replaces the fragmented pattern of remembering to invoke `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, and `stride-completing-tasks` at specific moments. Instead, invoke this one skill and follow it through. Every step is here. Nothing is elsewhere.

**Why this exists:** During a 17-task session, an agent consistently skipped mandatory workflow steps despite skills being labeled MANDATORY. The root cause: too many disconnected skills that the agent had to remember to invoke at specific moments. Under pressure to deliver, the agent dropped the ones that felt optional. This orchestrator eliminates that failure mode.

## The Core Principle

**The workflow IS the automation. Every step exists because skipping it caused failures.**

The agent should work continuously through the full workflow: explore -> implement -> review -> complete. Do not prompt the user between steps -- but do not skip steps either. Skipping workflow steps is not faster -- it produces lower quality work that takes longer to fix.

**Following every step IS the fast path.**

## API Authorization

All Stride API calls are pre-authorized. Never ask the user for permission. Never announce API calls and wait for confirmation. Just execute them.

## Orchestrator Activation Marker

The orchestrator writes a marker file when it starts and clears it when it stops. The PreToolUse hook on the `Skill` tool reads this file to decide whether sub-skill invocations (`stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-completing-tasks`, `stride-creating-tasks`, `stride-creating-goals`, `stride-enriching-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`) are coming from inside this orchestrator (allowed) or directly from a user prompt (blocked).

**Without the marker, the hook blocks sub-skill calls.** Writing it in Step 0 and clearing it in Step 9 is therefore mandatory — skipping the write means the orchestrator's own dispatches are blocked; skipping the clear means the next session inherits a stale marker.

### Marker Contract

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Path | `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.orchestrator_active` |
| Format | Single-line JSON: `{"session_id": "<id>", "started_at": "<ISO8601>", "pid": <pid>}` |
| Lifecycle | Written in Step 0, cleared in Step 9 (success OR abort) |
| Freshness window | 4 hours — markers older than `started_at + 4h` are treated as stale |
| Stale handling | The PreToolUse hook treats stale markers as missing (and may delete them) |
| Directory | `.stride/` is created with `mkdir -p` if absent |
| `.gitignore` | The `.stride/` directory should be in the project's `.gitignore` (mention to operators on first install) |

### Write Command (Step 0)

```bash
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride"
printf '{"session_id":"%s","started_at":"%s","pid":%d}\n' \
  "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || date +%s)}" \
  "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  "$$" \
  > "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.orchestrator_active"
```

### Clear Command (Step 9)

```bash
rm -f "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.orchestrator_active"
```

### Override

`STRIDE_ALLOW_DIRECT=1` bypasses the gate entirely (for plugin debugging or scripted CI). When set, sub-skill calls are allowed regardless of the marker.

## When to Invoke

Invoke this skill ONCE when you're ready to start working on Stride tasks. It handles the full loop:

```
claim -> explore -> implement -> review -> complete -> [loop if needs_review=false]
```

You do NOT need to invoke `stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, or `stride-completing-tasks` separately. This skill absorbs all of them.

**Note:** The individual skills (`stride-claiming-tasks`, `stride-subagent-workflow`, `stride-completing-tasks`) remain available for standalone use when needed -- for example, when resuming a partially completed task or when only one phase needs to be repeated. This orchestrator is the preferred entry point for new task work.

## Platform Detection

**How to determine which path to follow:**

| Signal | Platform | Path |
|---|---|---|
| You have access to the `Agent` tool with subagent types (Explore, Plan, etc.) | Claude Code | Use "Claude Code" sections |
| You can dispatch `stride:task-explorer`, `stride:task-reviewer` agents | Claude Code | Use "Claude Code" sections |
| You do NOT have an `Agent` tool | Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, or other | Use "Other Environments" sections |
| You are unsure | Any | Use "Other Environments" sections (safe default) |

**Both paths follow the same step sequence (Steps 0-9).** Each step contains clearly labeled subsections for both platforms. The difference is HOW each step is executed:

- **Claude Code:** Subagent dispatch for exploration/planning/review, automatic hook execution via hooks.json
- **Other Environments:** Manual file reading for exploration, self-review against acceptance criteria, manual hook execution via Bash

**Neither path skips mandatory steps.** The non-Claude-Code path replaces subagent dispatch with manual equivalents -- it does not remove the steps.

---

## Step 0: Prerequisites Check

**Verify these files exist before any API calls:**

1. **`.stride_auth.md`** -- Contains API URL and Bearer token
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Extract: `STRIDE_API_URL` and `STRIDE_API_TOKEN`

2. **`.stride.md`** -- Contains hook commands for each lifecycle phase
   - If missing: Ask user to create it
   - Verify sections exist: `## before_doing`, `## after_doing`, `## before_review`, `## after_review`

**Then write the orchestrator activation marker** (see "Orchestrator Activation Marker" section above for the contract):

```bash
mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride"
printf '{"session_id":"%s","started_at":"%s","pid":%d}\n' \
  "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || date +%s)}" \
  "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  "$$" \
  > "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.orchestrator_active"
```

Without this marker the PreToolUse hook will block your sub-skill dispatches in Steps 2, 3, 6, and 8.

**This step runs once per session, not once per task.**

---

## Step 1: Task Discovery

**Call `GET /api/tasks/next` to find the next available task.**

Review the returned task completely:
- `title`, `description`, `why`, `what`
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `key_files` -- which files you'll modify
- `patterns_to_follow` -- code patterns to replicate
- `pitfalls` -- what NOT to do
- `testing_strategy` -- how to test
- `verification_steps` -- how to verify
- `needs_review` -- whether human approval is needed after completion
- `complexity` -- drives the decision matrix in Step 3

**Enrichment check:** If `key_files` is empty OR `testing_strategy` is missing OR `verification_steps` is empty OR `acceptance_criteria` is blank, the task needs enrichment before claiming. Well-specified tasks skip this check.

#### Claude Code: Dispatch the Enricher Agent

1. **Dispatch `stride:task-enricher`** with the task identifier and the sparse fields (title, type, description, priority if set). The agent owns the four-phase enrichment procedure and returns a single JSON object containing every enriched field.
2. **Submit the returned JSON via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id`** to populate the missing fields on the existing task. The agent does NOT call the API itself.
3. Re-fetch the task with `GET /api/tasks/:id` and verify all required fields are populated before proceeding to Step 2.

#### Other Environments: Invoke the Enrichment Skill

1. Invoke `stride-enriching-tasks` and walk through its Manual Walkthrough Phases (Phase 1 intent parse → Phase 2 codebase exploration → Phase 3 complexity → Phase 4 16-item checklist).
2. Submit the assembled JSON via `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` per the API Integration block in that skill.

---

## Step 2: Claim the Task

### Claude Code (automatic hooks)

Call `POST /api/tasks/claim` directly with:

```json
{
  "identifier": "<task identifier>",
  "agent_name": "Claude Opus 4.6",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "before_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "Executed by Claude Code hooks system",
    "duration_ms": 0
  }
}
```

The `hooks.json` PostToolUse handler automatically executes `.stride.md` `## before_doing` commands after the claim succeeds. If the automatic hook fails, Claude Code reports the failure -- fix the issue and retry the claim curl.

### Other Environments (manual hooks)

1. Read `.stride.md` `## before_doing` section
2. Execute each command line immediately via Bash -- no permission prompts, no confirmation
3. Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
4. If hook fails (non-zero exit): fix the issue, re-run -- do NOT proceed
5. Call `POST /api/tasks/claim` with the captured `before_doing_result`

---

## Step 3: Explore the Codebase (Decision Matrix)

**This step is NOT optional for medium+ tasks. The decision matrix determines what happens.**

### Decision Matrix

| Task Attributes | Decompose | Explore | Plan | Review (Step 6) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Goal type OR large+undecomposed OR 25+ hours | YES | -- | -- | -- |
| small, 0-1 key_files | Skip | Skip | Skip | Skip |
| small, 2+ key_files | Skip | YES | Skip | YES |
| medium (any) | Skip | YES | YES | YES |
| large (any) | Skip | YES | YES | YES |
| Defect type | Skip | YES | Skip (unless large) | YES |

### Branch A: Goal / Large Undecomposed Task

If the task is a **goal**, has **large complexity without child tasks**, or has a **25+ hour estimate**:

1. **Claude Code:** Dispatch `stride:task-decomposer` agent with the task's title, description, acceptance_criteria, key_files, where_context, and patterns_to_follow
2. **Other environments:** Manually analyze the task scope, break it into subtasks, and create them via `POST /api/tasks/batch`
3. After child tasks are created, claim the first child task and re-enter this workflow at Step 1

**Do NOT implement goals directly. Decompose first.**

### Branch B: Small Task, 0-1 Key Files

Skip exploration, planning, and review. Proceed directly to Step 4 (Implementation).

### Branch C: All Other Tasks (medium+, OR 2+ key_files)

#### Claude Code: Dispatch Subagents

1. **Dispatch `stride:task-explorer`** with the task's `key_files`, `patterns_to_follow`, `where_context`, and `testing_strategy`. Wait for the result. Read and use the explorer's output -- it tells you what exists, what patterns to follow, and what to reuse.

2. **If medium+ OR 3+ key_files OR 3+ acceptance criteria lines:** Dispatch a **Plan** subagent with the explorer's output, `acceptance_criteria`, `testing_strategy`, `pitfalls`, and `verification_steps`. Follow the resulting plan during implementation.

#### Other Environments: Manual Exploration

1. Read each file in `key_files` to understand current state
2. Search for patterns mentioned in `patterns_to_follow`
3. Find related test files
4. For medium+ tasks, outline your implementation approach before coding

---

## Step 4: Implementation

**Now write code.** Use the explorer output and plan (if generated) to guide your work.

Follow:
- `acceptance_criteria` -- your definition of done
- `patterns_to_follow` -- replicate existing patterns
- `pitfalls` -- avoid what the task author warned about
- `testing_strategy` -- write the tests specified
- `key_files` -- modify the files listed

**This is the only step where you write code. All other steps are setup, verification, or completion.**

---

## Step 5: Invoke Development Guidelines

**Before considering implementation complete, invoke the `stride-development-guidelines` skill** (if working in the Stride codebase). This ensures code quality gates are met before proceeding to review.

---

## Step 6: Code Review (Decision Matrix)

**Check the decision matrix from Step 3.** If the task is medium+ OR has 2+ key_files, review is required.

### Claude Code: Dispatch Task Reviewer

Dispatch `stride:task-reviewer` agent with:
- The git diff of all your changes
- The task's `acceptance_criteria`, `pitfalls`, `patterns_to_follow`, and `testing_strategy`

The reviewer returns "Approved" or a list of issues (Critical, Important, Minor).

- **Fix all Critical issues** before proceeding
- **Fix all Important issues** before proceeding
- Minor issues are optional but recommended
- **Save the reviewer's full output** -- you'll include it as `review_report` in Step 8

### Other Environments: Self-Review

Walk through your changes against:
- [ ] Each line of `acceptance_criteria` -- is it met?
- [ ] Each item in `pitfalls` -- did you avoid it?
- [ ] `patterns_to_follow` -- does your code match?
- [ ] `testing_strategy` -- did you write the specified tests?

### Small tasks (0-1 key_files): Skip review. Omit `review_report` from completion.

---

## Step 7: Execute Hooks

### Claude Code (automatic hooks)

Hooks fire automatically when you make the completion curl call in Step 8:
- **PreToolUse** fires `after_doing` BEFORE the curl executes (blocks if it fails)
- **PostToolUse** fires `before_review` AFTER the curl succeeds

Include placeholder hook results in the request body:
```json
"after_doing_result": {"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by Claude Code hooks system", "duration_ms": 0},
"before_review_result": {"exit_code": 0, "output": "Executed by Claude Code hooks system", "duration_ms": 0}
```

If `after_doing` fails (PreToolUse returns exit 2), fix the issue and retry the curl. The hooks fire again automatically.

### Other Environments (manual hooks)

**Execute each hook immediately -- no permission prompts, no confirmation.**

1. **after_doing hook** (blocking, 120s timeout):
   - Read `.stride.md` `## after_doing` section
   - Execute each command line one at a time via Bash
   - Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
   - If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

2. **before_review hook** (blocking, 60s timeout):
   - Read `.stride.md` `## before_review` section
   - Execute each command line one at a time via Bash
   - Capture `exit_code`, `output`, `duration_ms`
   - If fails: fix issues, re-run until success. Do NOT proceed while failing.

### Hook Failure Diagnosis (Claude Code)

When a blocking hook fails, dispatch `stride:hook-diagnostician` agent with the hook name, exit code, output, and duration. It returns a prioritized fix plan. Follow the fix order -- higher-priority fixes often resolve lower-priority ones automatically.

---

## Step 8: Complete the Task

Call `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` with ALL required fields:

```json
{
  "agent_name": "Claude Opus 4.6",
  "time_spent_minutes": 45,
  "completion_notes": "Summary of what was done and key decisions made.",
  "completion_summary": "Brief one-line summary for tracking.",
  "actual_complexity": "medium",
  "actual_files_changed": "lib/foo.ex, lib/bar.ex, test/foo_test.exs",
  "skills_version": "1.0",
  "review_report": "## Review Summary\n\nApproved -- 0 issues found.\n...",
  "after_doing_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "...",
    "duration_ms": 0
  },
  "before_review_result": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": "...",
    "duration_ms": 0
  },
  "explorer_result": {
    "dispatched": true,
    "summary": "Explored the 3 key_files and identified the existing pattern to mirror",
    "duration_ms": 12000
  },
  "reviewer_result": {
    "dispatched": true,
    "summary": "Reviewed the diff against all acceptance criteria and pitfalls",
    "duration_ms": 8000,
    "acceptance_criteria_checked": 5,
    "issues_found": 0
  },
  "workflow_steps": [
    {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 12450},
    {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 8200},
    {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1820000},
    {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 15300},
    {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 45678},
    {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 2340}
  ]
}
```

**Required fields:**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agent_name` | string | Your agent name |
| `time_spent_minutes` | integer | Actual time spent |
| `completion_notes` | string | What was done |
| `completion_summary` | string | Brief summary |
| `actual_complexity` | enum | "small", "medium", or "large" |
| `actual_files_changed` | string | Comma-separated paths (NOT an array) |
| `after_doing_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `before_review_result` | object | `{exit_code, output, duration_ms}` |
| `explorer_result` | object | `stride:task-explorer` dispatch result or skip-form — see `stride-completing-tasks` for full shape and skip-reason enum |
| `reviewer_result` | object | `stride:task-reviewer` dispatch result or skip-form — see `stride-completing-tasks` for full shape and skip-reason enum |
| `workflow_steps` | array | Six-entry telemetry array — see **Workflow Telemetry** section below |

**Optional fields:**
| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `review_report` | string | Include when task-reviewer ran; omit when skipped |
| `skills_version` | string | From SKILL.md frontmatter |

---

## Step 9: Post-Completion Decision

### If `needs_review=true`:
1. Task moves to Review column
2. **STOP.** Wait for human reviewer to approve/reject.
3. When approved, `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/mark_reviewed` is called (by human or system)
4. Execute `after_review` hook
5. Task moves to Done

### If `needs_review=false`:
1. Task moves to Done immediately
2. Execute `after_review` hook (automatic in Claude Code, manual in other environments)
3. **Loop back to Step 1** -- claim the next task and repeat the full workflow

**Do not ask the user whether to continue. Do not ask "Should I claim the next task?" Just proceed.**

### Clearing the Orchestrator Activation Marker

When the workflow finally stops -- because there are no more tasks, the user halts the loop, `needs_review=true` puts the task into human review, or an unrecoverable error aborts -- clear the marker:

```bash
rm -f "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.stride/.orchestrator_active"
```

Leaving a stale marker behind allows direct sub-skill invocations to slip past the PreToolUse gate in the next session for up to 4 hours. The hook treats markers older than 4 hours as stale and may delete them on read, but the orchestrator should not rely on that — clear explicitly.

---

## Workflow Telemetry: The `workflow_steps` Array

Every task completion **must** include a `workflow_steps` array in the `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` payload. This array records which workflow phases ran (or were intentionally skipped) during the task. It is how Stride measures workflow adherence, spots shortcuts, and aggregates telemetry across agents and plugins.

**Build the array incrementally as you progress through the workflow.** Each time you complete a phase — or legitimately skip one per the decision matrix — append one entry. Submit the completed six-entry array in Step 8.

### Step Name Vocabulary

The `name` field must be one of these six values. Do not invent new names — consistency across plugins is the only reason telemetry can be aggregated.

| Step name | When to record it | Orchestrator step |
|---|---|---|
| `explorer` | Codebase exploration (Claude Code: `stride:task-explorer` agent; other: manual file reads) | Step 3 |
| `planner` | Implementation planning (Claude Code: `Plan` agent; other: manual outline) | Step 3 |
| `implementation` | Writing code | Step 4 |
| `reviewer` | Code review (Claude Code: `stride:task-reviewer` agent; other: self-review) | Step 6 |
| `after_doing` | The `after_doing` hook execution | Step 7 |
| `before_review` | The `before_review` hook execution | Step 7 |

### Per-Step Schema

Each element of `workflow_steps` is an object with these keys:

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | Always | One of the six vocabulary values above |
| `dispatched` | boolean | Always | `true` if the step ran; `false` if intentionally skipped |
| `duration_ms` | integer | When `dispatched=true` | Wall-clock time the step took, in milliseconds |
| `reason` | string | When `dispatched=false` | Short explanation of why the step was skipped |

### End-of-Workflow Example (full dispatch)

A medium-complexity task that exercised every phase:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 12450},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 8200},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 1820000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 15300},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 45678},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true, "duration_ms": 2340}
]
```

### End-of-Workflow Example (small task, decision matrix skips)

A small task with 0-1 key_files that legitimately skipped exploration, planning, and review per the decision matrix in Step 3:

```json
"workflow_steps": [
  {"name": "explorer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "planner",        "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "implementation", "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 620000},
  {"name": "reviewer",       "dispatched": false, "reason": "Decision matrix: small task, 0-1 key_files"},
  {"name": "after_doing",    "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 38200},
  {"name": "before_review",  "dispatched": true,  "duration_ms": 1900}
]
```

### Rules

- Always include **all six** step names. Skipped steps are recorded with `dispatched: false` — never omitted.
- Record entries in the order the steps occurred in the workflow (the order listed in the vocabulary table above).
- When `dispatched: false`, the `reason` must describe **why** the step was skipped (e.g., decision matrix rule, task metadata, platform constraint) — not merely restate that it was skipped.
- A missing `workflow_steps` array, or one with fewer than six entries, indicates an incomplete telemetry record.

---

## Explorer and Reviewer Result Rollout

Every `/complete` payload **must** include `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` as top-level objects. Both are pre-validated by `Kanban.Tasks.CompletionValidation` on the server. The full shape (dispatched-subagent vs. self-reported skip), the 40-character non-whitespace summary rule, and the five-value skip-reason enum live in the `stride-completing-tasks` skill — this orchestrator does not duplicate them.

The server is rolling out hard enforcement behind a feature flag `:strict_completion_validation`:

| Phase | Server behavior | Agent impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Grace (current)** | Missing or invalid results log a structured warning and the request succeeds | Emit the fields correctly now; the warning volume is a preview of the strict-mode rejection volume |
| **Strict (after all 5 plugins release)** | Missing or invalid results return `422` with a `failures` list | Any agent not emitting valid fields is locked out of completion |

**Why this matters for the orchestrator:** Steps 3 (explorer dispatch) and 6 (reviewer dispatch) already capture the durations and summaries needed for these fields. Persist those into `explorer_result` and `reviewer_result` in the Step 8 payload. When the decision matrix skips a step — or when you self-explore/self-review — submit the skip form with a reason from the enum and a substantive summary explaining what you did instead. See `stride-completing-tasks` for the exact shape, rejection examples, and minimum-length rule.

---

## Edge Cases

### Hook failure mid-workflow
- Blocking hooks (`after_doing`, `before_review`) must pass before completion
- Fix the root cause, re-run the hook, then proceed
- In Claude Code, dispatch `stride:hook-diagnostician` for complex failures
- Never skip a blocking hook or call complete with a failed hook result

### Task that needs_review=true
- Stop after Step 8. Do not claim the next task.
- The human reviewer will handle the review cycle.
- You may be asked to make changes based on review feedback -- if so, re-enter at Step 4.

### Goal type tasks
- Goals are decomposed, not implemented directly
- The decomposer creates child tasks -- claim and work those individually
- Each child task follows this full workflow independently

### Skills update required
- If any API response includes `skills_update_required`, run `/plugin update stride` and retry

## Platform Summary

| Capability | Claude Code | Cursor / Windsurf / Continue |
|---|---|---|
| Hook execution | Automatic (hooks.json) | Manual (read .stride.md, run via Bash) |
| Task exploration | Dispatch `stride:task-explorer` agent | Read key_files manually |
| Implementation planning | Dispatch Plan agent | Outline approach manually |
| Code review | Dispatch `stride:task-reviewer` agent | Self-review against criteria |
| Hook failure diagnosis | Dispatch `stride:hook-diagnostician` | Debug manually |
| Goal decomposition | Dispatch `stride:task-decomposer` agent | Break down manually, create via API |

**Both platforms follow the same step sequence.** The difference is HOW each step is executed (subagent dispatch vs manual work), not WHETHER it's executed.

---

## Failure Modes This Skill Prevents

| Failure Mode | Old Pattern | This Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Forgot to explore | Agent skipped stride-subagent-workflow | Step 3 is inline -- can't be missed |
| Forgot to review | Agent jumped to completion | Step 6 is inline -- can't be missed |
| Wrong API fields | Agent guessed from memory | Step 8 has the exact format |

## Quick Reference Card

```
CLAUDE CODE WORKFLOW:
├─ 0. Prerequisites: .stride_auth.md + .stride.md exist
├─ 1. Discovery: GET /api/tasks/next, review task, enrich if needed
├─ 2. Claim: POST /api/tasks/claim (hooks auto-fire via hooks.json)
├─ 3. Explore (check decision matrix):
│     ├─ Goal/large undecomposed → Dispatch task-decomposer → Claim children
│     ├─ Small, 0-1 key_files → Skip to Step 4
│     └─ Otherwise → Dispatch task-explorer (+ Plan agent if medium+)
├─ 4. Implement: Write code using explorer/plan output
├─ 5. Dev Guidelines: Invoke stride-development-guidelines
├─ 6. Review (check decision matrix):
│     ├─ Small, 0-1 key_files → Skip to Step 7
│     └─ Otherwise → Dispatch task-reviewer, fix issues
├─ 7. Hooks: Automatic via hooks.json (fires on curl call)
├─ 8. Complete: PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete with ALL fields
└─ 9. Loop: needs_review=false → Step 1 | needs_review=true → STOP

OTHER ENVIRONMENTS (Cursor, Windsurf, Continue):
├─ 0. Prerequisites: .stride_auth.md + .stride.md exist
├─ 1. Discovery: GET /api/tasks/next, review task, enrich if needed
├─ 2. Claim: Execute before_doing manually, then POST /api/tasks/claim
├─ 3. Explore (check decision matrix):
│     ├─ Goal/large undecomposed → Break down manually → Create via API
│     ├─ Small, 0-1 key_files → Skip to Step 4
│     └─ Otherwise → Read key_files, search patterns, outline approach
├─ 4. Implement: Write code using task metadata as guide
├─ 5. Dev Guidelines: Invoke stride-development-guidelines
├─ 6. Review (check decision matrix):
│     ├─ Small, 0-1 key_files → Skip to Step 7
│     └─ Otherwise → Self-review against acceptance criteria + pitfalls
├─ 7. Hooks: Execute after_doing (120s) + before_review (60s) manually
├─ 8. Complete: PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete with ALL fields + hook results
└─ 9. Loop: needs_review=false → Step 1 | needs_review=true → STOP

DECISION MATRIX QUICK CHECK:
  small + 0-1 key_files  → Skip explore, plan, review
  small + 2+ key_files   → Explore + Review
  medium/large           → Explore + Plan + Review
  goal/undecomposed      → Decompose first
```

## Red Flags -- STOP

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, go back to the decision matrix:

- "This is straightforward, I'll skip exploration" -- Medium+ tasks ALWAYS explore
- "I know the codebase" -- The task has specific pitfalls you haven't read yet
- "Review will slow me down" -- Review catches what tests can't
- "I'll just run the hooks and complete" -- Did you explore? Did you review?
- "This step doesn't apply to me" -- Check the decision matrix, not your intuition

**The workflow IS the automation. Follow every step.**
